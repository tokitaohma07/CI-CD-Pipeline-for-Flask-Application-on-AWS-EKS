# CI-CD-Pipeline-for-Flask-Application-on-AWS-EKS

## Project Summary

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for deploying a Flask application to AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) using Jenkins, Docker, AWS ECR, and Kubernetes. It covers the entire DevOps lifecycleâ€”from code integration, security scanning, containerization, and pushing images to ECR, to deploying the application on Kubernetes in a highly scalable cloud environment.
