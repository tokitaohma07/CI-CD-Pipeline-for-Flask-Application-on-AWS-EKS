# CI-CD-Pipeline-for-Flask-Application-on-AWS-EKS

# Project Summary

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for deploying a Flask application to AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) using Jenkins, Docker, AWS ECR, and Kubernetes. It covers the entire DevOps lifecycle—from code integration, security scanning, containerization, and pushing images to ECR, to deploying the application on Kubernetes in a highly scalable cloud environment.
